This python script helps generate a translated template to work on to speed up the translation workflow. It generates a file $language.po.new that you can fix up and then rename to $language.po.  In order to use this translator template generator you will want to run this to install the "polib" and "dl-translate" modules. Make sure GNU gettext utilities are installed!


```
pip3 install polib dl-translate

```


Further documentation on the modules is available here:

- [dl-translate](https://pypi.org/project/dl-translate/)
